# CEMACare Health System

![alt text](frontend/src/assets/dashboard.png)

CEMACare is a full-stack web application designed to manage health programs, clients, feedback, and suggestions for healthcare providers. It features a responsive React frontend with a modern UI and a Node.js/Express backend with SQLite for data persistence. The application supports user authentication, program management, client registration, and data visualization through charts.

## Features

- **User Authentication**:

  - Login and signup functionality with JWT-based authentication.
  - Secure password hashing using `bcryptjs`.
  - Session management with token-based authorization.

- **Dashboard**:
  - Overview of total programs, clients, and pending actions.
  - Create new health programs and register clients.
  - Visualize program creation trends and client registrations with charts (LineChart, BarChart).

- **Clients Management**:
  - Register, view, edit, and delete clients.
  - Assign clients to health programs (many-to-many relationship).

- **Programs Management**:
  - Create, view, edit, and delete health programs.
  - Modal-based viewing and editing with form validation.

- **Feedback and Suggestions**:
  - Submit, view, and delete feedback and suggestions.
  - Filter suggestions by category and search by title.
  - Star-based rating system for feedback.

- **Responsive UI**:
  - Sidebar navigation with toggle functionality.
  - Topbar with user profile, search, and notifications.
  - Mobile-friendly design with Tailwind CSS.

- **Security**:
  - Rate limiting with `express-rate-limit`.
  - Helmet for HTTP headers security.
  - Input validation using `express-validator`.

- **Deployment**:
  - Deployed on Vercel with separate builds for frontend (`@vercel/static-build`) and backend (`@vercel/node`).

- **JWT (jsonwebtoken)**: For token-based authentication.
- **Bcryptjs**: For password hashing.
- **Express Validator**: For request validation.
- **Helmet**: For securing HTTP headers.
- **Express Rate Limit**: For rate limiting API requests.
- **CORS**: For enabling cross-origin requests.

### Deployment
- **Vercel**: Platform for hosting the frontend.
- **Render**: Platform for hosting the backend
- **Vite**: Build tool for the frontend.
